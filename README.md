# RCDNN_MA
Regularized Chained Deep Neural Network made to deal with classification and regression tasks from multiple annotators. This method, termed RCDNN, jointly predicts the ground truth label and the annotators' performance from input space samples.  In turn, RCDNN codes interdependencies among the experts by analyzing the layers' weights and includes  l1, l2, and Monte-Carlo Dropout-based regularizers to deal with the overfitting issue in deep learning models.
